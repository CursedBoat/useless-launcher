Watch as an idiot tries to code a video game library manager that hardly works

## Features
- Epic interactive menu (amazing)
- I didn't even set anything up
- Don't use it

**If you want to build the code yourself, you will need** [FIGGLE](https://github.com/drewnoakes/figgle)

Making the menu was possible with the help of [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAWhGEPMlS8)
